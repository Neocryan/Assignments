### Question 9
#### ($a$)
(i) Is the produced Kronecker graph connected? 

b+c = 0.79<1 unconnected

(ii) Does the graph have a giant connected component of size $\Theta(n)$? Provide _theoretical justification_ of your answers. You can also confirm your answers by examining the properties of the graph (e.g., computing the actual size of the GCC).

(a+b)(b+c) =0.9875, so no gcc as $\Theta(n)$

#### ($b$)
Describe three structural properties which show that the produced graph looks similar (qualitatively or even quantitatively) to the CA-GrQc network. For each of those properties you should examine how they look like in both the original CA-GrQc network and produced Kronecker graph

The Kronecker graph is also power law distribution:

We can find that the degree, triangle and diameter distribution is very similar to the original network and follow a power law distribution.
