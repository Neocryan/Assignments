### Question 1
Let $A$ be the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph (unweighted, with no self-loops) and$\overrightarrow{1}$ be the column vector whose elements are all $\overrightarrow{1}$. In terms of these quantities and simple matrix operations like matrix transpose and matrix trace, write expressions for:
#### ($a$) 
The vector $k$ whose elements are the degrees $k_i$ of the nodes.
$$k = A \cdot \overrightarrow{1}$$
#### ($b$) 
The number $m$ of edges in the graph.
$$m = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j}{A_{i,j}} $$
#### ($c$) 
The matrix $N$ whose element $N_{i,j}$ is equal to the number of common neighbors of nodes i and j.
$$N_{i,j} = \sum{(\overrightarrow{A_i} + \overrightarrow{A_i}  == 2)}$$ $$\implies N = A^2$$
