# How to attract people to purchase existing dataset and to contribute（upload New datasets）

## Make the data more accessible and suitable for customers.


### __1. for the business propose:__
* Provides varieties formats for the dataset, SQL, NoSQL, HDFS …
* Have an entry for the start-ups or researchers to search a cluster of data which enough and concise for analyzing.
* May have some steps, asking questions like: Who you are; Which industry; What's the goal; Format and time range ….
* Train the question-set using machine learning and try to give the best cluster of data sets.
* For example, if someone wants to start a restaurant.  And he/she indicate the role and the goal, we may give him/her data sets like transactions about vegetables, fruit, meat, cheese and so forth. In which way the man can find out what's popular now and what his competitor is doing -- if he is smart enough.

* Need to subscript for the whole raw dataset.
* Optimized for the common courses like network graphic analysis,  machine learning, data preprocessing and so on. 
* Give discount for the schools and research intuition and try to make the students and researchers royal to the API.
* Provides MOOCS for example to teach newcomers how to make full use of the API.
___________
## Provide Analysis, Forecasting, Cloud Computing services.
* Connect the AWS API to make automatic analysis through machine learning or other tools. The price is the fee from AWS adds some surcharges for data usage.
* Convince consulting company to provide consulting service.
* Build own research and analysis team. 
___________

## Contribute
* Discounts (data usage) for users who upload valid and new datasets.
* Welcome companies to open their data and start competations on the platform
* Discounts (consulting fees) for users who take their own data to consult and willing to open the data.
