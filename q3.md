### Question 3
Let G = (V;E) be an unweighted, undirected graph with no self-loops. The $(i; j)$-th element of $A^l$ (i.e.,
the adjacency matrix raised to the l-th power) counts the number of paths of length l that start from node i and end at node j. A triangle in a graph corresponds to a clique of three nodes.
#### ($a$)
Using simple matrix operations, express the total number of triangles in the graph $\Delta(G)$, as a function of the adjacency matrix $A$.
$$\Delta(G) = \frac{1}{6} \times trace(A^3)$$ 
#### ($b$)
Similarly, express the total number of triangles in the graph $\Delta(G)$ as a function of the eigenvalues
$$\Delta(G) = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=1}^{n}\lambda_i^3$$
#### ($c$)
Express $\Delta_i$ as a function of the spectrum (i.e., eigenvalues and/or eigenvectors) of the adjacency matrix A.

$$\Delta_i = \frac{\sum_j \lambda_j^3 u_{i,j}^2}{2}$$
where $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue of A and $u_{i,j}$ is the i-th entry of the j-th eigenvector
