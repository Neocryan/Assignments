### Question 2
Consider a bipartite network, with its two types of nodes (type 1 and 2), and suppose that there are $n_1$ nodes of type 1 and $n_2$ nodes of type 2. Show that the mean degrees $c_1$ and $c_2$ of the two types are
related by
$$c_2 = \frac{n_1}{n_2} \cdot c_1$$


\
\
\
Total edges = $c_1 \times n_1 = c_2 \times n_2$
$$\implies c_2 = \frac{n_1}{n_2} \cdot c_1$$
