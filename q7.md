### Question 7
#### ($a$)
(1) Compute the following statistics: number of nodes, number of edges. 

	ca = nx.read_edgelist('CA.txt')
	print('Total edge is {}'.format(ca.number_of_edges()))
	print('Total node is {}'.format(ca.number_of_nodes()))

Total node is 5242
Total edge is 14496 


(2) If the graph is not connected: 

	nx.is_connected(ca)
	>False
Graph is not connected.

(i) find the number of connected components (CCs); 

	nx.number_connected_components(ca)
	>355
There are 355 connected components in total.

(ii) plot the distribution of their sizes (similar to MSN’s connectivity shown in Lecture 1B, slide number 81). 

	ccc = sorted(nx.connected.connected_components(ca),
	key = len, reverse=True)
	size = []
	for i in range(len(ccc)):
	    size.append(len(ccc[i]))
	size_dict = []
	for i in set(size):
	    size_dict.append((i,size.count(i)))
	plt.draw()
	plt.scatter(np.log10(np.array(size_dict)[:,0]),np.log10(np.array(size_dict)[:,1]))
	plt.xlabel('log10-number of nodes')
	plt.ylabel('log10-count')
	plt.title('loglog - distribution of connected_component size')
	
	plt.draw()
	plt.scatter(np.array(size_dict)[:,0],np.array(size_dict)[:,1])
	plt.xlabel('number of nodes')
	plt.ylabel('count')
	plt.title('distribution of connected_component size')
	plt.show()

(3) Extract the largest (i.e., giant) connected component (GCC), and then (i)find the number of nodes and edges of GCC and 

	Gcc0=sorted(nx.connected_component_subgraphs(ca), key = len, reverse=True)
	Gcc=Gcc0[0]
	nx.number_of_edges(Gcc)
	nx.number_of_nodes(Gcc)
	
	>GCC's number of nodes: 4158
	>GCC's number of edges: 13428

(ii) the fraction of nodes and edges of the whole graph that belong to GCC (e.g., 5% of the number of nodes are part of GCC). Discuss briefly your observation (2-3 lines).

	nx.number_of_nodes(Gcc) / ca.number_of_nodes()
	>0.7932086989698588
	nx.number_of_edges(Gcc) / ca.number_of_edges()
	>0.9263245033112583
79% of nodes are part of GCC and 92.63% of edges belong to GCC.
It means that in a collaboration network, most of the collaboration are in one huge community. 

#### ($b$)
(1) Find the minimum, maximum, median and mean degree
of the nodes of the graph. What do you observe (please, discuss briefly in 1-2 lines)? 

	degree_sequence=sorted(nx.degree(ca),key = lambda x : x[-1],reverse=True) # degree sequence
	degree_single = np.array([a for a in map(lambda x : x[-1],degree_sequence)])
	dmax = degree_single.max()
	dmin = degree_single.min()
	dmed= np.median(degree_single)
	dmean = np.mean(degree_single)
	print('the minimum degree is {}'.format(dmin))
	print('the maximum degree is {}'.format(dmax))
	print('the median degree is {}'.format(dmed))
	print('the mean degree is {}'.format(dmean))
	
	>the largest degree is 81, from node '21012
	>the smallest degree is 1
	>the minimum degree is 1 
	>the maximum degree is 81 
	>the median degree is 3.0 
	>the mean degree is 5.530713468141931

The max degree is very huge comparing to the mean and the median degree. And most nodes have a relatively small degree.

(2) Visualize (appropriately) the degree distribution of the graph. What is the type of the degree distribution and what are the parameters? 

	degree_count = []
	for i in set(degree_single):
	    degree_count.append((i,list(degree_single).count(i)))
	
	plt.scatter(np.array(degree_count)[:,0],np.array(degree_count)[:,1])
	plt.xlabel('degree')
	plt.ylabel('count')
	plt.title('degree distribution of the graph')
	plt.show()

	
	plt.scatter(np.log(np.array(degree_count)[:,0]),np.log(np.array(degree_count)[:,1]))
	plt.xlabel('degree')
	plt.ylabel('count')
	plt.title('log-log degree distribution of the graph')
	plt.show()

Here are the distribution graph with and without scaling.
And we can see that the no scaling plot is like a gamma distribution and the log-log plot is a powerlaw.

Theoretically, a log-log plot and powerlaw distribution is better, but here I also provide the gamma fitting.

	import powerlaw
	result = powerlaw.Fit(degree_single)
	print(result.power_law.alpha)
	print(result.power_law.xmin)
	plt.loglog(np.array(degree_count)[:,0],np.array(degree_count)[:,1]/Gcc.number_of_nodes())
	result.plot_pdf()3e

Where alpha = 2.4798207102186045 and xmin = 6.0.

	import scipy.stats as stats  
	fit_alpha, fit_loc, fit_beta=stats.gamma.fit(degree_single,loc=0)
	print(fit_alpha, fit_loc, fit_beta)
	>0.7736347358841043 0.9999999999999999 5.494551030468298

	import seaborn as sns
	sns.kdeplot(degree_single,bw = 0.5,label= 'data')
	sns.kdeplot(np.random.gamma(0.773,5.49,5242),bw = 0.5,label = 'gamma')

where $\alpha$ = 0.7736, $\beta$ = 5.5 

#### ($c$)
(1) Compute the total number of triangles in the GCC of the network. 

	tri_dict = nx.triangles(Gcc)
	tri_list = [x for x in map(lambda x:tri_dict[x], tri_dict)]
	print('total triangles in GCC is {}'.format(np.sum(tri_list)/3))

total triangles in GCC is 47779.0

(2) Visualize (plot) the triangle participation distribution, i.e., a histogram that shows the number of triangles that each node participates in (i.e., how many nodes participate in one triangle, how many nodes participate in two triangles, etc). Note that, this process is similar to the computation of the degree distribution. Discuss briefly your observations.

	sns.kdeplot(np.array(tri_list),bw = 5,label= 'triangles')
	plt.xlabel('number of triangles')
	plt.ylabel('density')

Make a log-log plot to make it clearer. 

	plt.scatter(np.log10(tri_count[:,0]),np.log10(tri_count[:,1]),marker = 'o')
	plt.xlabel('log10 - number of triangles')
	plt.ylabel('log10 - count ')
	plt.title('loglog distribution of number of triangles')

Most nodes are within a low number of triangles. But meanwhile, some of the nodes have a relatively high number of triangles. This shows that the network is approximately power law distribution.

#### ($d$)
(1) Why is this happening? Explain your answer, giving specific arguments. [Hint: we can do low rank approximation of the adjacency matrix for the computation of triangles, taking advantage of some of the “power-law” properties of real networks that we have seen in class].

We see that the top k eigenvalues can estimate the total number of triangles well. 
Because the network is approximately a powerlaw, the maximum degrees are getting more detached from the rest and so do the top eigenvalues. 

(2) Suppose that we approximate $\Delta(G)$ with $\Delta^{\prime}_k(G)$. Compute and visualize the error of approximation for various values of k

	tri_esti = []
	for i in [1,10,50,100,200,500,800,1000]:
	  tri_esti.append(np.sum(scipy.sparse.linalg.eigs(nx.adjacency_matrix(Gcc).asfptype(),k = i)[0]**3/6))
	plt.plot([1,10,50,100,200,500,800,1000], tri_esti,label = 'estimated')
	plt.plot([1,10,50,100,200,500,800,1000], [number_real for x in range(8)],label = 'real')
	plt.ylabel('number of triangles')
	plt.xlabel('k')
	plt.legend()
	plt.show()

We can see that the estimated number of triangles approaches to the real number as values of k increase. And when k is near 200, the estimated number is close to the real value.
